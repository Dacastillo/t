Amorphous Carbon (aC) is a material of recent interest in Material Sciences. For all its applications is of fundamental importance the evaluation of mechanical and thermodynamical properties. In this paper an Classical MD simulation study is presented and compared with different interatomic potentials. This study was done using several empirical potentials, putting de aC samples made from simple cubic lattices into temperature ramps. For all samples it was measured phase change point to graphite and bulk modulus, looking for thermodynamical properties of the material. It was obtained phase change temperatures of the order of $2000 K$ for different potentials and Bulk modulus of the order of $200-300 GPa$. The best achievement of all potential was reached by EDIP potential.
